# Challenge_1
Week 1 Challenge

In this repository it contain an edited version of a website mainly in the apects of code optimization and organization.

For this project I did not see it necessary to have very descriptive titles for each class so i renamed most classes to say the bare minimum information
while still being able to make the connection to what it is and contains.

I left some notes since there were things not clarified such as which set of fonts you want to use over the other and also minor things that looked like errors
but could have been artisitc choices such as the main header of the website being diffrent shade of white/grey than the rest.

I also allowed for the future editing of this website to be multiplatform with the viewport code yet certain optimizations such as that and the issues that occurs with the pictures 
during the resizing of the website to either large or really small monitors such as split screen or wide screen were not specified for the conditions of this assignment
and so were ignored
